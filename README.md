To achieve real-time hand tracking with a virtual line displayed on my computer, I began by connecting my phone to my computer using the Iriun Webcam app, which allowed my phone to function as a webcam. I utilized ChatGPT to create and refine Python scripts that incorporated MediaPipe for hand detection and OpenCV for video processing. Through a process of trial and error, I fine-tuned the scripts in PyCharm, as it provided less lag than Jupyter. After implementing the hand tracking logic, I successfully displayed a green virtual line on the video feed from my phone, counting the crossings of my hand in real time. This project serves as a prototype for a small project that aims to track fish behavior in a fish tank.
